## 2. Wizard Foundation: Defining Your Organization
**Subtitle:** Establish the core identity of Akara Airlines within the wizard.

**Explanation:** The initial 'Organization' module in the Job Architecture Wizard is where you lay the cornerstone of your entire framework. This involves formally defining Akara Airlines as the primary entity. While this may be pre-populated in a demonstration environment, in a live scenario, you would meticulously enter these details.


**Key Points:**
*   Navigate to the 'Organization' section within the wizard's interface.
*   Accurately input 'Akara Airlines' into the 'Organization Name' field.
*   In the 'Description' field, provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of Akara Airlines' mission, vision, or market positioning.
*   This foundational data ensures all subsequent architectural components (Business Units, Departments, etc.) are correctly contextualized under the Akara Airlines umbrella.
*   Upon completion, the wizard's 'Next' or 'Save & Proceed' function will typically advance you to the Business Unit definition stage.

**Your Role:** Your objective is to ensure Akara Airlines' foundational identity is precisely captured in the wizard. This includes the official name and a strategic description that reflects its brand and operational scope, forming the apex of your job architecture.

## 3. Structuring Akara Airlines: Defining Business Units
**Subtitle:** Segment Akara Airlines into core operational and strategic divisions within the wizard.

**Explanation:** The 'Business Unit' module empowers you to segment Akara Airlines into its primary operational pillars or strategic profit centers. These are high-level divisions that represent distinct areas of your business, such as 'Passenger Aviation Services,' 'Cargo & Logistics,' 'Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (MRO),' or 'Pilot Training Academies.'


**Key Points:**
*   Within the wizard, navigate to the 'Business Unit' creation or management area.
*   For each distinct division, input a clear 'Business Unit Name' (e.g., 'Akara Passenger Services', 'Akara Cargo Solutions').
*   Provide a 'Description' that encapsulates the Business Unit's core mission, scope, and strategic objectives.
*   The wizard will ensure each Business Unit is hierarchically linked under the 'Akara Airlines' organization.
*   This segmentation is crucial for targeted resource allocation, performance management, and specialized operational oversight.

**Your Role:** Your task is to strategically delineate Akara Airlines' major operational segments as Business Units in the wizard. This involves accurately naming them and articulating their distinct contributions to the overall enterprise, ensuring a clear and logical top-tier structure.

---

## 4. Detailing Operational Units: Defining Departments
**Subtitle:** Further refine Business Units into functional departments within the wizard.

**Explanation:** The 'Department' module allows for a more granular breakdown of your Business Units into specialized functional areas. For example, within 'Akara Passenger Services,' you might define departments like 'Flight Operations Command,' 'In-Flight Services,' 'Airport Customer Experience,' and 'Crew Scheduling.'


**Key Points:**
*   Access the 'Department' management interface, likely associated with a selected Business Unit.
*   Utilize the 'Add Department' function to create new departmental entries.
*   Input a precise 'Department Name' (e.g., 'Flight Operations Command') and a 'Description' detailing its specific responsibilities and scope.
*   Crucially, ensure each Department is correctly linked to its parent 'Business Unit' using the wizard's selection tools. This maintains the hierarchical integrity of your architecture.
*   Defining clear departments is vital for assigning accountability, managing resources effectively, and streamlining operational workflows.

**Your Role:** Your responsibility is to accurately map Akara Airlines' functional subdivisions as Departments within the wizard, ensuring each is clearly defined and correctly aligned under its respective Business Unit. This detailed structuring is key to operational clarity.

## 5. Organizing Talent: Establishing Role Groups
**Subtitle:** Categorize jobs into logical families for streamlined management and development.

**Explanation:** The 'Role Groups' (often synonymous with Job Families) module in the wizard is pivotal for organizing similar types of roles based on shared functions, skills, and career trajectories. For Akara Airlines, examples include 'Flight Crew Operations,' 'Aircraft Engineering & Maintenance,' 'Airport Customer Services,' 'Commercial & Revenue Management,' and 'Corporate Support Functions.'


**Key Points:**
*   Within the wizard's interface, locate the 'Role Groups' or 'Job Families' section.
*   To create a new Role Group, use the 'Add Role Group' or equivalent function.
*   Enter a clear and standardized 'Role Group Name' (e.g., 'Flight Crew Operations').
*   Provide a 'Description' that outlines the overarching purpose and scope of roles within this group.
*   The wizard may offer fields to associate the Role Group with a primary 'Department' (though a Role Group can span multiple departments), define its 'Status' (e.g., 'Active', 'In Design'), and add relevant 'Tags' (e.g., 'safety-critical', 'customer-facing', 'technical-specialist') for enhanced searchability and reporting. Some tags might be intelligently suggested by the wizard.
*   Establishing well-defined Role Groups is fundamental for consistent job leveling, targeted L&D programs, and effective workforce analytics.

**Your Role:** Your objective is to use the wizard to create a comprehensive set of Role Groups that accurately reflect the diverse professional disciplines within Akara Airlines. This involves clear naming, descriptive summaries, and appropriate categorization to build a logical foundation for your job architecture.

## 6. Standardizing Progression: Defining Job Levels
**Subtitle:** Establish a clear, consistent hierarchy of seniority and responsibility across Akara Airlines.

**Explanation:** The 'Job Levels' module within the wizard is designed to establish Akara Airlines' standardized framework for career progression and organizational hierarchy. These levels (e.g., L1: Associate, L2: Analyst/Specialist, L3: Senior Analyst/Lead Specialist, L4: Manager/Principal, L5: Senior Manager/Director) are applied consistently across various Role Groups. This ensures uniformity in job titling, compensation structures, and performance expectations, thereby facilitating transparent career development and equitable talent management practices across the enterprise.


**Key Points:**
*   Navigate to the 'Job Levels' or 'Grading Structure' section of the wizard.
*   For each level, use an 'Add Job Level' function to define its parameters:
    *   <u>Level Name/Code:</u> A standardized identifier (e.g., 'L1', 'L2', 'P1', 'M3').
    *   <u>Level Title/Descriptor:</u> A clear title (e.g., 'Associate Level', 'Senior Professional', 'Manager I', 'Executive Lead').
    *   <u>Description:</u> Detail the general expectations, scope of responsibility, typical years of experience, and degree of autonomy associated with this level.
    *   <u>Core Competencies (Optional):</u> Some advanced wizards allow linking core leadership or functional competencies expected at each level, along with target proficiency.
    *   <u>Salary Band Link (Optional):</u> If integrated, you might link each level to a predefined salary band in your compensation system.
*   This framework is crucial for transparent career pathing, equitable compensation, and consistent performance management across Akara Airlines.

**Your Role:** Your role is to meticulously define each job level within the wizard, ensuring that the descriptions and distinctions are clear, meaningful, and consistently applicable across Akara Airlines. This framework underpins fair talent management and clear employee growth trajectories.

## 7. Wizard Core: Defining Jobs & Mapping Critical Skills
**Subtitle:** Meticulously craft individual job profiles and link essential skills using the wizard's dedicated modules.

**Explanation:** This module represents the core of the Job Architecture Wizard, where the granular details of each specific job role within Akara Airlines are meticulously defined. This comprehensive process is typically structured into distinct tabs or sections within the wizard's interface, ensuring thorough data capture for every position, such as 'Captain (A320 Type Rated)' or 'Senior Aircraft Maintenance Engineer'. Accurate and complete data entry in this section is paramount, as it directly informs talent acquisition, learning and development, and performance management strategies.


**Key Points:**
*   Typically, you'll start by selecting a parent Role Group (e.g., 'Flight Operations') and then initiate an 'Add New Job' action within the wizard.
*   The wizard will then guide you through several tabs or sections to build the complete job profile:

    **1. Basic Information Tab:**
    *   <u>Job Title:</u> Enter the official, standardized title (e.g., 'Captain - A320'). Ensure consistency with Akara Airlines' naming conventions.
    *   <u>Requisition ID (Optional):</u> If this job is linked to an active recruitment process, enter the corresponding Applicant Tracking System (ATS) Requisition ID here for seamless integration.
    *   <u>Employment Type:</u> Select the appropriate status from the wizard's dropdown (e.g., 'Full-Time Permanent', 'Part-Time Contract', 'Fixed-Term').
    *   <u>Work Location:</u> Specify the primary operational base or typical work environment (e.g., 'DXB - Akara Airlines Main Hub', 'Line Maintenance - Hangar 3', 'Remote/Global Operations').
    *   <u>Hiring Manager & Recruiter (Optional):</u> Assign the responsible Hiring Manager and Talent Acquisition Partner from your HRIS data, if the wizard integrates this.
    *   <u>Salary Range (Optional):</u> Input the approved minimum and maximum salary figures for this role, aligning with Akara Airlines' compensation bands. This aids in benchmarking and pay equity.

    **2. Role Group & Level Tab:**
    *   <u>Role Group Assignment:</u> This field confirms the job's placement within the broader job family structure (e.g., 'Flight Crew', 'Aircraft Engineering'). It might be pre-filled if you initiated job creation from within a specific Role Group in the wizard.
    *   <u>Job Level:</u> Select the predefined Job Level (e.g., 'L5' for Captain, 'L3' for First Officer, 'L2' for Junior Mechanic) from Akara Airlines' global leveling framework. This ensures hierarchical consistency and clarifies seniority.
    *   <u>Department & Business Unit:</u> Accurately link the job to its specific Department (e.g., 'A320 Fleet Operations') and, by extension, its parent Business Unit (e.g., 'Akara Passenger Services'). The wizard may auto-populate the Business Unit based on the selected Department, streamlining data entry.

    **3. Job Description Tab:**
    *   <u>Role Summary:</u> Craft a compelling and concise (2-3 sentences) overview of the job’s core purpose, its primary contribution to Akara Airlines, and its overall scope of responsibility.
    *   <u>Key Responsibilities:</u> Enumerate 5-7 primary duties, tasks, and accountabilities using clear, action-oriented language. For a 'Captain - A320', this would include items like 'Ensures safe and efficient operation of A320 aircraft' or 'Manages and leads flight and cabin crew'.
    *   <u>Qualifications & Experience:</u> Detail mandatory and preferred qualifications. For example:
        *   <em>Certifications:</em> 'Valid ATPL with A320 Type Rating', 'Class 1 Medical Certificate'.
        *   <em>Education:</em> 'Bachelor’s Degree in Aviation Management or equivalent (Preferred)'.
        *   <em>Experience:</em> 'Minimum 5,000 total flight hours, including 1,500 hours as Pilot-in-Command on A320 family aircraft'.
    *   <u>Additional Information/Benefits (Optional):</u> A space for any other pertinent details, such as travel requirements, or a standardized blurb about Akara Airlines' employee benefits package, if configured in the wizard.

    **4. Skills Mapping Tab:**
    *   <u>Skill Identification:</u> Leverage the wizard's integrated 'Skill Navigator'—this might be an intelligent search bar, a browsable category tree, or an AI-powered suggestion engine—to select skills from Akara Airlines’ central Skills Ontology. This ontology is the single source of truth for all defined skills.
    *   <u>Skill Types:</u> The Skills Ontology will likely categorize skills (e.g., 'Technical Aviation Skills', 'Operational Skills', 'Regulatory Compliance', 'Leadership Competencies', 'Soft Skills'). The wizard should allow you to filter by type or clearly display the type for each skill.
    *   <u>Proficiency Level Assignment:</u> For each selected skill (e.g., 'A320 Flight Systems Management', 'Crew Resource Management', 'International Aviation Law', 'Decision Making Under Pressure'), assign the target proficiency level required for successful job performance. This is typically done using a predefined scale within the wizard (e.g., 1-Foundational, 2-Intermediate, 3-Advanced, 4-Expert).
    *   <u>Criticality (Optional):</u> Advanced wizards may allow you to flag certain skills as 'Mission Critical' or 'Essential vs. Desirable' for the role, aiding in prioritization for recruitment and development.
    *   <u>AI Skill Suggestions:</u> Pay attention to any AI-driven recommendations. The wizard might analyze the job title and description to suggest relevant skills from the ontology or even identify emerging skills in the aviation industry that Akara Airlines should consider.

**Your Role:** Your critical responsibility in this module is to meticulously and accurately populate all relevant fields across these tabs for every job defined at Akara Airlines. The precision of your 'Skills Mapping'—linking the right skills at the correct proficiency levels—is paramount, as this data directly fuels talent acquisition, learning and development initiatives, performance management, and strategic workforce planning.
