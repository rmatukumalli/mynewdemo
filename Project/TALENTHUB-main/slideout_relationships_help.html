    <h2>Understanding Relationship Types</h2>
    <p>Here’s a breakdown of the benefits of each interrelationship type in your ontology:</p>

    <h3>Hierarchy Relationships (taxonomy structure)</h3>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>Part of (e.g., Design Thinking Methodologies → Innovation)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Helps build a modular skills tree so that when someone develops one component skill, the platform can suggest the parent skill and related siblings.</li>
            <li>Enables organizations to see which broader capability areas a person covers.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>isGeneralizationOf (Broader Skill)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Useful for role mapping — if a person knows “Data Science,” the platform can infer exposure to more specialized child skills.</li>
            <li>Helps in career matching at scale, since general skills often appear in many job families.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>isSpecializationOf (Niche Skill)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows granularity in skill validation — a candidate with “NLP” expertise is not just a data scientist, but a specialist in AI subfields.</li>
            <li>Drives precision in talent redeployment and project staffing by pinpointing depth areas.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Learning Path Relationships (sequencing and dependencies)</h3>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>Prerequisite (Foundation Skill)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Structures learning journeys — platforms can recommend what to learn first (e.g., Algebra before Calculus).</li>
            <li>Prevents skill gaps by showing dependencies between beginner and advanced skills.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>isSuccessorTo (Next Step Skill)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fuels career progression recommendations — when an employee masters a skill, the platform can suggest the next logical one.</li>
            <li>Supports upskilling pathways for succession planning.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>isCorequisiteWith (Parallel Skill)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Surfaces bundled learning opportunities — e.g., “Statistics + Data Visualization” should be learned together.</li>
            <li>Improves team design — ensuring projects have both complementary skill sets at the same time.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Associative Relationships (lateral links)</h3>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>Related to (Trend Spotting ↔ Future Forecasting)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Broadens discovery — employees can explore adjacent skills that enrich their core expertise.</li>
            <li>Encourages cross-disciplinary innovation by connecting skills that often co-occur.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>isComplementaryTo (Complementary Skill)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fuels role readiness analysis — e.g., Python + Machine Learning is stronger than either alone.</li>
            <li>Suggests skill pairings for development plans.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>isAlternativeTo (Alternative Skill)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Supports talent mobility — if an employee knows React, they can transition into Angular roles more easily.</li>
            <li>Provides flexibility in matching candidates to projects, recognizing skill substitutes.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>isSimilarTo (Similar Skill)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces redundancy in skill frameworks by linking near-duplicates.</li>
            <li>Enhances search and recommendations — a query for “Agile” also surfaces “Scrum.”</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Contextual Relationships (application and constraints)</h3>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>isUsedIn (Project Management)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Places skills in real-world contexts, making ontology more relatable.</li>
            <li>Strengthens role-to-skill mapping by connecting abstract skills to applied domains.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>isEnabledBy (Leadership)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Shows capability dependencies — leadership may enable effective project management.</li>
            <li>Helps in designing blended development programs (technical + behavioral).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="relationship-type">
        <h4>isContradictoryTo (Outdated Method)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeps frameworks current and future-ready by signaling that some skills are declining.</li>
            <li>Guides reskilling efforts away from outdated practices toward emerging skills.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
