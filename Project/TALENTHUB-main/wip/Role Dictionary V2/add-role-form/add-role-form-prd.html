    <section>
        <h2 id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This product requirement document describes building an "Add/Edit Role Form" feature integrated with the existing Role Dictionary system. This feature aims to streamline the process of defining, adding, and modifying roles within the organization, ensuring data consistency and completeness. This functionality will comply with defined user-level permissions.</p>
        <p>It answers to an identified market opportunity (improved data governance and operational efficiency), is aligned with our company strategy of enhancing HR and talent management tools, and leverages our unique competitive edge (integrated skills ontology and role architecture) with a pilot phase planned for Q4 2025.</p>
        <p><strong>Success criteria:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>● 90% user satisfaction rating for the role creation process.</li>
            <li>● 75% reduction in manual data entry errors for new roles.</li>
            <li>● Integration with existing role architecture and skills ontology achieved by launch.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Phase Context and Scope Clarification</h2>
        <p>This PRD is focused on Phase 2 of the Role Dictionary and Role Architecture initiative. The Phase 1 work, completed earlier, delivered a redesigned Role Dictionary and Role Profile with full feature parity compared to the legacy system. Phase 2 builds on that foundation by enhancing the Add/Edit Role form, capturing richer role metadata to support the future Role Architecture (planned for Phase 3).</p>
        <p>As part of Phase 2, the goal is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expand the Role Profile with additional fields and capabilities that will become critical inputs into the hierarchical Role Architecture.</li>
            <li>Improve usability and data quality by introducing guidance and automation features.</li>
            <li>Lay the groundwork for reporting, analysis, and downstream systems by standardizing data capture and structure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These enhancements will feed into Phase 3, where the organization will develop and implement a full Role Architecture framework, including hierarchies, departments, job families, and career paths.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Market Opportunity</h2>
        <p>The market for integrated HR and talent management solutions has shown a consistent growth rate of 12% CAGR due to increasing demand for structured talent data and efficient workforce planning. Currently, it’s at an early growth stage (20% market penetration), providing ample room for capturing substantial value. TAM projected at $500M by 2028.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Strategic Alignment</h2>
        <p>The "Add Role Form" aligns with our company’s focus on providing comprehensive and intuitive talent management solutions. It directly supports our mid-term objective of increasing adoption of the Role Dictionary by 30% by simplifying the role creation process and ensuring data quality. This plays to our strengths in developing robust data management tools and leveraging our proprietary skills ontology.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Customer & User Needs</h2>
        <p>Users in the HR Administrator and Talent Acquisition Specialist segments spend significant time daily on defining and inputting new role descriptions, resulting in frequent inconsistencies and manual errors. 60% of users report this as their top pain (source: internal user interviews, n=50, high importance vs. low satisfaction). Constraints: Data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) require careful handling of role-related data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Value Proposition & Messaging</h2>
        <p>The "Add Role Form" reduces manual data entry and inconsistencies by 75%, saving HR professionals significant time and effort, addressing the pain point of inefficient role definition with a guided, multi-step input process and real-time validation. Unlike generic HRIS systems, we offer deep integration with our proprietary skills ontology and role architecture, ensuring highly accurate and structured role data. Messaging: "Streamline role definition with intelligent, integrated forms for precise talent management."</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Competitive Advantage</h2>
        <p>The "Add Role Form" leverages our unique proprietary skills ontology and existing Role Dictionary architecture, giving us a 12-18 month competitive lead. Unlike competitor approaches that rely on manual input or basic templates, our specific advantage is hard to replicate due to the complexity and depth of our integrated data models and the established user base of the Role Dictionary.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Product Scope and Use Cases</h2>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Generated versions will be stored temporarily (e.g., in local session storage) and will not be persisted to the database until the user explicitly clicks "Save Draft" or "Submit" for the entire role form. This ensures that only desired content is saved permanently.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide users with flexibility and control over AI-generated content, allowing them to explore multiple options and refine suggestions to best fit their needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Implement an "Export to Excel" feature, accessible from the "Review & Edit" step (Step 9) and potentially from a role management dashboard. This will generate a structured Excel file containing all data fields and sections of the role definition.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To facilitate offline review, data sharing with stakeholders who prefer spreadsheet formats, and integration with other systems that rely on Excel imports. The standardized format ensures data consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation Notes:</strong> The Excel template should have clearly defined columns corresponding to each field, including nested data (e.g., skills with proficiency levels) in a readable format.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>7.10.5 Bulk Import/Export Roles</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Enhance the existing import/export functionality to support bulk operations for all fields and sections defined in the "Add Role Form." This includes both importing multiple new role definitions from a standardized Excel or CSV template and exporting a comprehensive dataset of existing roles.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To enable efficient migration of large volumes of role data, support mass updates, and provide robust data backup and integration capabilities. This extends the utility of the Role Dictionary for larger organizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation Notes:</strong> The import process should include robust validation, error reporting for failed imports, and clear instructions for template population. The export should generate a template that can be directly used for re-import.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>7.10.6 Role Architecture Linkage</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Introduce specific fields or metadata within relevant form steps (e.g., "Organization & Position Structure," "Classification & Hierarchy") that allow users to indicate how the role is expected to fit into the future Role Architecture. This includes fields for Job Family, Job Level, and potential Career Path indicators.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To lay the groundwork for Phase 3's full Role Architecture framework by capturing essential hierarchical and structural data now. This proactive data capture will simplify downstream mapping, integration, and the eventual implementation of career pathing and organizational design tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation Notes:</strong> These fields will initially function as data capture points. While the full hierarchical logic will be implemented in Phase 3, the data captured in Phase 2 must be structured to be forward-compatible with the planned architecture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>7.10.7 Skills Ontology Integration</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> The "Add Role Form" will integrate with the existing Skills Ontology to provide structured data for role definition. Specifically, the integration will leverage the following ontology objects:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Used for populating "Required Skills" and "Preferred Skills" fields (Section 7.4) with standardized skill definitions, including proficiency levels. This enables auto-completion, search, and consistent skill mapping.</li>
                    <li><strong>Roles:</strong> Used for populating fields related to organizational structure, such as "Reporting To" and "Career Path/Next Roles" (Sections 7.2 and 7.5), allowing linkage to existing role definitions within the system.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To ensure data consistency, leverage existing organizational knowledge, and facilitate accurate reporting and analysis by linking new role definitions to a standardized skills and role framework.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation Notes:</strong> The integration will primarily involve read-only access to the Skills and Roles objects for data lookup and suggestion. Future phases may explore write-back capabilities or more complex relationships. Integration with "Person/User," "Content," and "Projects" ontology objects is outside the scope of Phase 2 for the "Add Role Form."</li>
