    <section>
        <h2 id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This product requirement document describes building an "Add/Edit Role Form" feature integrated with the existing Role Dictionary system. This feature aims to streamline the process of defining, adding, and modifying roles within the organization, ensuring data consistency and completeness. This functionality will comply with defined user-level permissions.</p>
        <p>It answers to an identified market opportunity (improved data governance and operational efficiency), is aligned with our company strategy of enhancing HR and talent management tools, and leverages our unique competitive edge (integrated skills ontology and role architecture) with a pilot phase planned for Q4 2025.</p>
        <p><strong>Success criteria:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>● 90% user satisfaction rating for the role creation process.</li>
            <li>● 75% reduction in manual data entry errors for new roles.</li>
            <li>● Integration with existing role architecture and skills ontology achieved by launch.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Phase Context and Scope Clarification</h2>
        <p>This PRD is focused on Phase 2 of the Role Dictionary and Role Architecture initiative. The Phase 1 work, completed earlier, delivered a redesigned Role Dictionary and Role Profile with full feature parity compared to the legacy system. Phase 2 builds on that foundation by enhancing the Add/Edit Role form, capturing richer role metadata to support the future Role Architecture (planned for Phase 3).</p>
        <p>As part of Phase 2, the goal is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expand the Role Profile with additional fields and capabilities that will become critical inputs into the hierarchical Role Architecture.</li>
            <li>Improve usability and data quality by introducing guidance and automation features.</li>
            <li>Lay the groundwork for reporting, analysis, and downstream systems by standardizing data capture and structure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These enhancements will feed into Phase 3, where the organization will develop and implement a full Role Architecture framework, including hierarchies, departments, job families, and career paths.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Market Opportunity</h2>
        <p>The market for integrated HR and talent management solutions has shown a consistent growth rate of 12% CAGR due to increasing demand for structured talent data and efficient workforce planning. Currently, it’s at an early growth stage (20% market penetration), providing ample room for capturing substantial value. TAM projected at $500M by 2028.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Strategic Alignment</h2>
        <p>The "Add Role Form" aligns with our company’s focus on providing comprehensive and intuitive talent management solutions. It directly supports our mid-term objective of increasing adoption of the Role Dictionary by 30% by simplifying the role creation process and ensuring data quality. This plays to our strengths in developing robust data management tools and leveraging our proprietary skills ontology.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Customer & User Needs</h2>
        <p>Users in the HR Administrator and Talent Acquisition Specialist segments spend significant time daily on defining and inputting new role descriptions, resulting in frequent inconsistencies and manual errors. 60% of users report this as their top pain (source: internal user interviews, n=50, high importance vs. low satisfaction). Constraints: Data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) require careful handling of role-related data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Value Proposition & Messaging</h2>
        <p>The "Add Role Form" reduces manual data entry and inconsistencies by 75%, saving HR professionals significant time and effort, addressing the pain point of inefficient role definition with a guided, multi-step input process and real-time validation. Unlike generic HRIS systems, we offer deep integration with our proprietary skills ontology and role architecture, ensuring highly accurate and structured role data. Messaging: "Streamline role definition with intelligent, integrated forms for precise talent management."</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Competitive Advantage</h2>
        <p>The "Add Role Form" leverages our unique proprietary skills ontology and existing Role Dictionary architecture, giving us a 12-18 month competitive lead. Unlike competitor approaches that rely on manual input or basic templates, our specific advantage is hard to replicate due to the complexity and depth of our integrated data models and the established user base of the Role Dictionary.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
