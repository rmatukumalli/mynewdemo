1. Product Overview
<strong>Career Pathing is a strategic capability designed to empower employees to visualize, plan, and navigate their professional growth within the organization.</strong> It provides a transparent, structured framework that outlines potential career trajectories, detailing the skills, experiences, and roles required for advancement. By leveraging AI to generate dynamic paths based on real-world, successful career progressions within the company, this tool aims to demystify career growth. <strong>The primary goal is to enhance internal mobility, boost employee engagement, and increase retention by making career progression transparent, achievable, and actionable.</strong>
Core Distinction: This capability fundamentally evolves career pathing from a traditional, fixed "career ladder" to a <strong>dynamic, multi-directional network.</strong> While the "Branching Network View/Subway Map" provides a familiar, structured look at established progressions, the <strong>AI-powered "Radar View" is the core innovation. It uncovers viable, alternative pathways—including lateral and diagonal moves—based on real-world data of how successful careers actually unfold</strong>, rather than relying on predefined, linear steps. This ensures employees see a realistic and expansive set of opportunities based on their unique skills.
2. Goals and Objectives
• <strong>Increase Employee Retention: Reduce attrition by providing clear, tangible growth opportunities within the company. Target: Decrease voluntary turnover by 15% within 18 months of launch.</strong>
• <strong>Boost Internal Mobility: Facilitate the movement of talent across different roles and departments. Target: Increase the rate of internal hires for open positions by 25% within one year.</strong>
• <strong>Enhance Employee Engagement: Empower employees to take ownership of their career development, leading to higher job satisfaction. Target: Improve employee engagement scores related to career growth by 20% in the next annual survey.</strong>
• Improve Workforce Planning: Provide leadership with insights into potential career trajectories to better forecast talent supply and demand.

4A. Future Enhancements / Additional Features
For the Learner (Employee):
• Mentorship Tools: Tools for scheduling mentorship sessions, tracking progress, and providing feedback.
• Communication Integration: Integration with communication tools (e.g., Slack, Teams) for easy connection.
• Structured Programs: Support for different types of mentorship (e.g., formal, informal, reverse mentorship).
• Community Creation: Functionality for users (not just admins) to create and manage internal communities of practice or interest groups.
For the Admin:
• Advanced Analytics: Analytics on mentorship program participation, mentor/mentee satisfaction, and impact on employee development.
• Event Configuration: Configuration options for creating, managing, and promoting networking events.
For the HR Representative:
• Manager Team Building: A feature to help managers use skill data to find employees for new project teams.
• Impact Reporting: Reporting on the impact of connection programs on employee retention, skill development, and internal mobility.
• Participation Promotion: Tools to promote and encourage participation in mentorship and networking activities across the organization.
• Talent Management Integration: Integration with talent management systems to track mentorship as part of an employee's official development record.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
• Privacy & Security: Participation is voluntary. All data must be secure, and users must opt-in to be discoverable.
• Performance: Directory searches must load in under 2 seconds.
• Usability: The process of finding and connecting with a mentor should be simple and intuitive.
6. Use Cases
• Use Case 1 (Learner): Alex filters the directory for "Public Speaking," finds Maria, a Sales Director, and sends her a connection request to learn about her experience.
• Use Case 2 (Admin): Sarah creates a mentorship program for high-potential female leaders, enrolls participants, and uses the system's suggestions to confirm 15 optimal pairings.
7. Technical Specifications
• Frontend: React.js.
• Backend: Node.js/Python.
• Search: Elasticsearch for fast and relevant directory filtering.
• Database: PostgreSQL.
• Integrations: APIs for HRIS (profiles), Calendar (scheduling), and Communication tools (Slack/Teams).
8. Dependencies
• Employee Profile Data: Relies on the HRIS for accurate employee information.
• Skills Ontology: The skill search feature is dependent on the master Skills Ontology.
• Employee Participation: Success is contingent on employees volunteering as mentors and mentees.
9. Timeline and Milestones
• Phase 1 (MVP):
◦ Milestone 1: Build the employee directory, profiles, and connection workflow. Launch the Community & Events Hub (view only).
• Phase 2 (Program Management):
◦ Milestone 2: Build the Mentorship Program and Community Management tools for Admins, along with dashboards for HR.
• Phase 3 (Enhancements):
◦ Milestone 3: Implement deeper integrations and features from the "Future Enhancements" section.
10. Assumptions and Constraints
• Assumption: A significant number of experienced employees will volunteer to be mentors.
• Constraint: The initial launch may face a "chicken-and-egg" problem requiring a targeted campaign to get both mentors and mentees on board.
